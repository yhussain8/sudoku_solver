I love solving Sudoku puzzles although I  have yet to master the techniques needed to solve the harder problems.

With this project, I hope to write a Python script that will help me automate the steps that I am already familiar so that I can focus my attention on experimenting with and discovering techniques that can help me solve any given Sudoku puzzle.

While I am aware of the many Sudoku solving algorithms out there, I am hoping to build my own solver from scratch before comparing it with others.

To start, I will attempt to solve the Easy, Medium, Hard puzzles from the New York Times as published on August 24, 2023.
